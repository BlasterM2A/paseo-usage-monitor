/**
 * The Antigravity card's document: the vendor's own quota buckets, plus what
 * every Antigravity client on this machine actually spent.
 *
 * Both halves are needed because they answer for different ledgers. The quota
 * route reports the consumer Antigravity plan, and a request that runs under
 * the user's own Cloud project — which is how Paseo reaches the model — never
 * decrements it. Observed live: the weekly bucket held 0.7627758 remaining
 * across an hour in which Paseo spent 75M tokens on `google-antigravity`.
 *
 * So usage is counted per client, from the logs each one writes:
 *   - the Antigravity app, the `agy` CLI and the ACP bridge, out of their own
 *     conversation stores (see `antigravity-clients.server.ts`);
 *   - Paseo, out of the omp transcripts the history surface already reads, so
 *     the two surfaces cannot disagree.
 *
 * A client with nothing in the widest window contributes no rows at all, which
 * keeps the card free of zeros for tools the user does not have installed.
